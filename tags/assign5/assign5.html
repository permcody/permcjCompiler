In this assignment you will
convert your compiler into a full code generating compiler.
This is the moment we have been waiting for.  Congratulations!
You have created
a large complex program that will compile programs!  You will
be able to compile a C- program and amazingly it will execute on the TM
machine.  It is so cool to see the code actually run!  This was our
goal starting in January.
<p>
To do this final stage,
you will need to make modifications to the sementic section
and to create a code generation section.  The assignment below
combined with what you learn in class will tell you what you 
will need to do to get this to work. 
<p>
The results will be a C- compiler that will compile files for
execution on the TM machine.  The assignment will be graded by
running your compiler on each test file and generating code
if there are no errors (warnings are OK).  The code will then be given to the
TM machine to execute.  Your code running on my TM will
need to produce the same behavior as my code on my TM.
The programs will start out extremely simple and get harder. 
<p>
I will try to write about 10 for the testing phase and then
about 10 more for the grading phase.
<p>
There will also be two contests (bonus assignment 6) that will be run
separately to compete for the most compact code in instruction space
that performs the same as my code and a second that is for the fewest
number of instructions executed.  There will be some restrictions on
what you can and cannot do in your compiler.  The test programs will
not be available ahead of time but they will be broad so that many
things you do to improve your compiler will help.  There contest 
winners (top 5 in each category)
will get some number of bonus points TBD and their names will we
sung in songs of glory remembered down through the ages much like 
what's-his-name from last year... :-)  Rules will be given in 
the bonus assignment.
<p>
<h3>Command Line Improvements</h3>
<p>
<ol> 
<li> Add the <b>-o filename</b> option that lets the user specify where 
the tm code will go.  This option can go anywhere in the command argument
list.  If it is not specified then the code will be written to stdout.
Some example invocations:
<pre>
c- fred.c- -o fred.tm
c- -o fred.tm -p fred.c- 
c- fred.c- 
c- < fred.c-
</ol>
(HINT: See the <a href=../getopt.txt>man page for the getop</a> and
look at the optind variable.  You can use getopt to swallow options
up to the first thing that isn't an option.  Then you can read
the nonoption in.  Then you can try to get more options.  This
is a small change by adding a loop and using the optind variable.) 
<p>
<h3>The Semantic Analysis Changes</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Remove the print statements from the error token lines.</b>  They
are nice while debugging how the error token stuff works and in duplicating
my output but they need to be cleared out.  Leave the rest of the error
token stuff in the parser.
<p> 
<li>Next you will need to <b>augment the TreeNode</b> to handle offsets of 
space on local and global space for declared variables.  This
you can do was we described in class.  The result will be that
every declaration that requires space will store the offset of that
space
and the size in the treenode.  A flag for whether the space
comes from the global space or local space will also be set.
<p>
The offset and size that is used for variables goes unused for
all the rest of the nodes accept the function declaration nodes
which will borrow the size for storing the top of the local memory 
on exit of the code generation for the declarations in each function.
The offset in function declaration nodes will be used later for
storing the starting address of the function so that it can be looked up
in the symbol table.
<p>
<li>
The symbol table is already used to point to the TreeNodes
so you can now find the offset of <b>every</b> reference to a variable when
you arrive at them and look them up in the symbol table.  You can
now <b>copy that information for use in those referencing nodes</b>
(e.g. variables in equations) as well.
<p>
<li>
When you leave the Semantic Analysis section the symbol table will
have been reduced back down to the globals section.  If you freed
the symbol table before... don't... you should <b>pass symbol table
of globals</b> along with
the <b>end of the global space</b> to the code generation section as described
below.
<p>
<li> 
When I did the compiler 
I included function and parameter declaration tree nodes for the
<b>I/O routines:</b>
input, output, inputb, and outputb in the symbol table.
I Frankensteined this in the tree
before processing any parts of the tree for the code.  That way the types
for I/O routines can be compared.  The semantic section is responsible for
setting the size to the locals so you will need to do that manually in the
nodes you declare as well as return type and types of arguments. 
Here is the list of the four I/O routines:
<per>
int input(void)
int inputb(void)
void output(int)
void outputb(bool)
</pre>
HINT: You can see you will need 4 function nodes and 2 parameter nodes.
<li>
</ol>
<p> 
<h3>The Code Generator</h3>
<p>
If there are no errors (warnings OK), 
the Code Generation section will take the annotated tree, the 
symbol table containing the pointers to the global declaration nodes
and the value of the top of the global space and generate the TM
code as discussed in class.  (HINT: I passed the size of the global
space in a separate variable from the tree.)
<p> 
<ol> 
<p>
<li> I recomment you clone and cannibalize your semantic tree
traversal for your code generator.  The code generator is written to
<b>traverse the tree generating the code</b> by producing code snipits for
the different nodes encountered.  This may include code before,
processing children, between processing then and after processing 
them. 
<p>
I will supply you with the <b>emit code</b> you can use to write out
TM code.  If you want to modify this code or do it completely differently
then great.  Be my guest.  This is your compiler.
<p>

<li> Figure out (or do as I suggested in class) how to <b>install the 
I/O routines</b> and install the <b>prolog code</b>.  This task
consists of putting in the prolog with the jump to main in the right
place and placing the first frame right after the globals (as we discussed
in class).  The code for the I/O routines is copied into place
after the prolog and the offset in the
declartion nodes in the symbol table is updated to reflect where each
routine lays in memory.
<p>
The prolog and 
I/O code <b>must be exactly as given</b>.  This restriction will be 
true for the contest as well.  Your optimizations will be in the
remainder of the code.

<p>
<li> Although the offset, size, type of  all declared symbols is in
the annotated tree, the <b>offsets for temporary space</b> and <b>the location
in instruction space</b> of the various routines can't be known until
code generation time.  You will need to manage a temporary offset for
the temporary stack used as described in class for holding pending values
in calculating expressions. 
<p>
You will need to put the address of each routine as you come
across the declartion during code generation.  Calls can then
be managed by symbol table lookups.
<p>
<li>You may do the simple <b>backpatching</b> illustrated in my
code or you can save more information and do a more clever
job of backpatching to produce more compact/efficient code.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>Extra Credit (50pts)</h3> 
<p>
Add a <b>-m</b> option to the compiler which prints memory layout out
by traversing the annotated
parse tree.  In particular this includes the offsets, size (where relevant)
and whether the symbol
is global, parameter, or local (the values you need to generate the code
anyway).  This is an excellent debugging tool for making sure you get
the memory layout right so I highly recommend you do this anyway.
This is extra credit for the whole course so it is added post letter grade
assignment to see if you get a higher letter grade.  Put the code for
this between the semantic phase and the code generation phase. 
<p>
For the file
mem.c- in the tests above and using: 
<pre> 
c- -m Tests/mem.c- -o z.tm
</pre>
the output looks <b>exactly</b> like:
<pre>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>
Homework will be submitted as an <b>uncompressed</b> tar file to the
<a href=../submitTar.html>homework submission</a> page.  You can
submit as many times as you like.  <b>The LAST file you submit BEFORE the
deadline will be the one graded.</b>   For all submissions you will receive
email showing how your file performed on the pre-grade tests.  The
grading program will use more extensive tests and those results will
be mailed to when they are run.

If you have tests you really think are important or just cool please
send them to me and I will consider adding them to the test suite.

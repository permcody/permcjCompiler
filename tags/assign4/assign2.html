<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
This homework consists of these tasks:
<ul>
<li>Tweak-in some improvements to the interface.
<li>Use Flex and Bison to
build a parser for the <a href=c-Grammar.pdf>C- language</a>.
(Note that the grammar was updated when I caught some typos and
that I have added the % operator as in in C.)
<li>While doing the parsing you will construct the syntax tree.  This
is <b>not</b> the annotated syntax tree but just the initial tree.
<li> 
You will write the procedure <b>printTree</b> which will 
print out the tree exactly as I have in the examples I
give below.  <b>printTree</b> is declared:
<pre>
void printTree(FILE *, TreeNode *);
</pre>
Your main program will contain:
<pre>
yyparse(); 
printTree(stdout, syntaxTree);
</pre>
The first line calls the parser which will store the tree in
the global called <b>syntaxTree</b> which is defined:
<pre>
TreeNode *syntaxTree;
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
These tasks are descibed further below.
 
<h3>Improving the interface</h3> 
<p>
When done with this assignment you will have created code that will
recognize legal <b>C-</b> programs and generate the first pass at
the tree. 
<p> 

The parser will be named <b>c-</b> just like last time.  It will read
and process a stream of tokens from a filename given as the first
argument to the <b>c-</b> command or from standard input if the
filename argument is not present.
<p> 

It will now also take the <b>-d</b> option as a first argument.  I
recommend using the <a href=../getopt.txt><b>getopt</b></a> routine since
this will handle UNIX arguments in a uniform and standard way.  The
<b>-d</b> option turns on the yydebug flag by setting it to 1.  <p>
For example: <b>c- -d sort.c-</b> should run the <b>c-</b> compiler
on the program sort.c- and give details of the parsing that is going on.
While <b>c- sort.c-</b> should simply run the <b>c-</b> compiler.
 
<p> 
Your compiler should now record the line number and last token
scanned in
global variables.  Rewrite your <b>yyerror</b> routine to
print a message as in this error message:
<pre>
printf("ERROR lineno(%d):%s.  I got: %s\n", lineno, msg, scanToken);
</pre>
The <b>msg</b> is passed into the <b>yyerror</b> routine as we will
discuss in class.
You can write out the error message using any method you like but the 
content of the error message must be exactly like the above.
To get this all to work nicely,
turn on verbose error messaging with:
<pre>
#define YYERROR_VERBOSE
</pre>
We will continue to improve on the invocation line and error reporting as
our compiler gets more sophisticated.
<b>HINT:</b> As we will discuss it class it is important that
the you allocate a new string for each token as it is scanned to
avoid the problem of referring to a reusable buffer.

<h3>The Parser</h3>
<p>
For the parsing part of the assignment modify your Bison grammar to
parse C- code.  A good approach is to initially forget about the
syntax tree part of the assignment.  If you get the right grammar
into your compiler it will successfully parse any <b>C-</b> program.
A program that simply recognizes whether a program is legal or not
is called a <b>recognizer</b>.  When you build your bison grammar directly from
the one supplied you will find that you have the dangling else problem. 
There are several ways to fix this problem.  I will discuss one in class. 
<b><font color=red>Coding restriction:</font></b>
Do not fix this or any other problem with your
grammar by using the <b>%expect</b> feature of Bison.  This
causes Bison to ignore some number of parsing errors and me to
deduct points from your assignment.  Really, you can do this with out this "feature".

<p>
Now that your recognizer is working.  Let's look at the syntax tree I want 
you to produce.  As we will discuss in class the tree is an abbreviated portion
of the parse tree containing the parts we are interested in.  Here is a sample
TreeNode that I used:
<pre>
typedef struct treeNode
{
    struct treeNode *child[MAXCHILDREN];   // children of the node
    struct treeNode *sibling;              // siblings for the node
    NodeKind nodekind;                     // type of node
    union                                  // subtype of type
    { 
	DeclKind decl;                     // used when DeclK
	StmtKind stmt;                     // used when StmtK
	ExpKind exp;                       // used when ExpK 
    } kind; 
    union                                  // relevant data in type -> attr
    {
        OpKind op;                         // type of token (same as in bison)
	int val;                           // used when ConstantK
	char *name;                        // used when IdK 
    } attr; 
    ExpType expType;		           // used when ExpK for type checking
    int size;                              // used for size of array
    bool isArray;                          // is this an array
    bool isBool;                           // is this a Boolean 
} TreeNode; 
</pre>
This design is stolen straight from the book.  This way you can
use the one in the book as an example to work from.  Ours has to
have extra features and node types.  We will discuss this in detail in
class.
 
<p>
To encode the program as a tree you need to make the right nodes
at the right steps in the parsing.  When you need to make a node you
will use routines you write similar to the <b>newStmtNode</b>
function in <b>util.c</b> in Tiny.  These will be passed up the
tree and assembled as in the tiny example in the book.
<b><font color=red>Coding restriction:</font></b>
<b>Do not use
YYSTYPE</b> as used in the book.  This subverts features that 
are there to <b>help you</b>.  I will discuss how to use 
this to your advantage.
I will also talk about how to use this:
<pre>
%union {
    int number;
    char *string;
    TreeNode *tree;
}
</pre>
<p> 

<h3>The Parser and printTree</h3>
So what should the tree look like for a given program?
This is essentially described the the Bison code.  I think
the best way to describe this is in class and by example.

To understand the examples you must understand the output format
of the <b>printTree</b> function.
The <b>printTree</b> function prints the the important
information contained in the node pointed to by
the second argument.  It then applies the <b>printTree</b> function
to all the nonnull children and prints them out numbered by
their index in the <b>child</b> array.  It then follows the
<b>sibling</b> pointer if it is nonnull and applies
the <b>printTree</b> function to that.  The first sibling
found is numbered 1.  Reading the syntax tree printed
for sample input programs shows you what to do in each case.

For example, given this program:
<pre>
int max(int x, int y) { 
    int z; 
    if (x>y) z=x;
    else z=y;
    return z;
}
</pre>
you should get the following output from your <b>c-</b>.  The // comments are
<b>not part of the output</b> but to explain what you are seeing.
<pre> 
Function max returns int      // this is the declaration node for a function
Child: 0                      // it has 2 children.  Child 0 are parameters.
    Param x of type int       // the first parameter is x of type int
    Sibling: 1                // the parameters are tied together as a linked list of siblings
    Param y of type int       // the second parameter is y of type int
Child: 1                      // the second child of the function declaration is the statements
    Compound                  // the body of a function is treated as a compound statement
    Child: 0                  // the first child of a compound statement is a list of declarations
        Var z of type int     // z is declared of type int
    Child: 1                  // the second child of a compound statement is a list of statements
        If                    // the if node has two or three children 
        Child: 0              // the first child is the test
            Op: >             // a relational operator > applied
            Child: 0          // to the two children 
                Id: x         // the first of which is x 
            Child: 1
                Id: y         // the second is y
        Child: 1              // the second child of the if is the then clause
            Assign            // z = x
            Child: 0 
                Id: z 
            Child: 1
                Id: x
        Child: 2              // the third child of the if is the else clause
            Assign            // z = y 
            Child: 0 
                Id: z
            Child: 1
                Id: y
        Sibling: 1            // the second statement in the body of the compound statement
        Return                // return which takes as its only child
        Child: 0 
            Id: z             // the variable z
</pre>
In the cases where there is an optional expression or statement the
corresponding child pointer is set to NULL (i.e. 0).
For example compound statements might not have any declarations so <b>child[0]</b>
would be set to NULL.  Return optionally takes an expression.  If there isn't an
expression then the <b>Child[0]</b> is NULL.  The while statement might not
have a body: for example <b>while (searching());</b> in which case <b>child[1]</b>
is NULL.  The default for unneeded children and siblings is always NULL. 
<p> 

<b>HINT:</b> The yacc code in the book is a good example of how to
connect the nodes you create.  The node create code is a good model
for how to create nodes and print a tree.  Use your notes from class
on how to put the rest of it together.

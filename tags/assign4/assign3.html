In this assignment we will do semantic analysis and semantic error 
generation.  We will also add some more command line options.

<h3>Two New Compiler Options</h3>

This time we add <b>two new options</b>.  The first option is
<b>-p</b> which prints the syntax tree.  That is it prints the syntax
tree we did for assignment 2 but with the line numbers attached to
every node.  See the section Tracking Line Numbers below.  <p> The
second option is <b>-s</b> and turns on symbol table tracing.  See the
secion the symbol table below.  <p> Original option <b>-d</b>
continues to turn on the yydebug option as specified in assignment 2.
It should still accept a single input file either from a filename
given on the command line or redirected as standard input.  We will
continue adding options throughout the semester.  The options need not
come before the file name.  (HINT: I have added <a
href=getoptTest.cpp><b>a getopt example</b></a> that is a silly example of
how to do a variety of things with getopt.  This will make your life
easier and let you focus on the compiler stuff.  I still have the <a
href=getopt.txt><b>getopt man page</b></a> available.  )

<h3>Tracking Line Numbers</h3>

There are two kinds of errors we will generate in this assignment.
The lexical/syntax errors that are reported with yyerror and the
semantic errors that are reported as described in this assignment.
(We will worry about integrating these errors in
the next assignment.)

<h4>Lexical/Syntax Errors</h4>

These errors are reported by yyerror which recieves information
about the current token being scanned and the current linenumber
by global variable.  This you have done for assignment 2.  It
will be tested in this assignment.

<h4>Semantic Errors</h4>

We want to generate errors that are tagged with useful
line numbers.  So we will need to tag each node in the
abstract syntax tree with a useful line number.
To do this effectively we need to grab the line
number as soon as possible (in flex) and associate it
with the token.  This can be done nicely(portably)
by passing back a struct for each token in the yylval
which has all the information about the token such
as its line number, lexeme, constant value, even token class.
(A struct allows you to return more than a single value.)
It can also be done with global variables but remember that
yylval provides a stack that can remember for you
the contents of a struct.  A single value may be overwritten.
Then when you construct a node annotate the node with 
the pertinent line number.
<p>
I modified my printTree routine to call a printNode
routine whenever I wanted to see the conents of a node.
Then I modified the print node routine to print the line
number on each node.
Kind of like in this segment out of a listing:
<pre>
        .
        .
        .
    Child: 0
        Var z of type int [line: 3]
    Child: 1
        If [line: 5]
        Child: 0 
            Op: > [line: 5] 
            Child: 0
                Id: x [line: 5]
            Child: 1
        .
        .
        .
</pre>
The test routines can turn on your print with the -p option
and print out the line numbers for the comparison routine
and grading.  This will help us get our line numbers in sync.
It also helps you to get the nodes annotated as we would want them.
<p>
The question is which node's linenumber do you use
to issue the error?
For example, if there is a problem with a big long hairy while statement
we will what
tag the error where the while token is.  
One could have used the line number from the test but
that could become tricky if the test goes over multiple lines.
A clear decision on the major tokens is given below.
<p>
Here are node types and where the line is said to be:
<pre>
//declarations
VarK    at the ID
FuncK   at the ID
ParamK  at the ID
//statements
IfK       at the IF
WhileK    at the WHILE
CompoundK at the {
ReturnK   at the RETURN 
BreakK    at the BREAK
//operators
OpK        at the operator
ConstantK  at the constant 
IdK        at the ID 
AssignK    at the =
CallK      cat the ID
</pre>
So, in a declaration of a variable
the declaration node of type VarK is said to 
be on the line that the ID token was found. 
"If" statements are where the IF token was found etc.
This battle plan suggests an implementation for the error checking.

<h3>Scope and Type Checking</h3>
 
Now we will traverse the tree looking for typing and
program structure errors.  So your main() might look something like 
mine:
<pre>
    {// compile the code 
	int numErrors;

	yyparse();

	if (printSyntaxTree) printTree(syntaxTree);

	numErrors = scopeAndType(syntaxTree);
	printf("Number of errors: %d\n", numErrors);
 
    } 
</pre>

Your main may look quite different.  The routine scopeAndType will
process the tree by calling a treeTraverse routine that starts at the
root node for the tree and recursively calls itself for children and
siblings until it gets to the leaves.  Declarations will make entries
in the symbol table (see below).

Here is an <b>outline</b> of what the declarations section of the
treeTraverse wmight look like (yours may be different):

<pre>
             .
             .
             .
    // handle declarations
    if (current->nodekind == DeclK) {
        switch (current->kind.decl) {
        case VarK:
            insertErr(current);
            break;
        case ParamK:
            insertErr(current);
            break;
        case FuncK:
            currentFuncType = current->expType; // Save function type -> need it to check return type
            insertErr(current);
            symtab->enter(current->attr.name);
            newScope = false;
            treeTraverse(current->child[0]);
            treeTraverse(current->child[1]);
            symtab->leave(); 
            break; 
        default:
            printf("SYSTEM ERROR: Unknown declaration node kind!\n");
            break;
        }
    }
             .
             .
             . 
    //handle statements
    else if (current->nodekind == StmtK) {
        switch (current->kind.stmt) {
        case CompoundK:
            if (newScope) symtab->enter("compoundStmt");
            else newScope = true;
            treeTraverse(current->child[0]);
            treeTraverse(current->child[1]);
            symtab->leave();
            break;
             .
             .
             . 
         case IfK:
            child0 = treeTraverse(current->child[0]);
	    if (child0) {
                if ((child0->expType!=ErrorType) && (child0->expType != Boolean)) {
                printf("ERROR lineno(%d): Expecting boolean test condition.\n",
                   child0->lineno);
                numErrors++;
                }
		.
		.
		.
	    }
            treeTraverse(current->child[1]);
            treeTraverse(current->child[2]);
            break;
             .
             .
             . 

</pre>

Your job in writing the treeTraverse routine is to catch a variety of
errors and duplicate my output for any input given.  You should keep
count of the number of errors in a global and report that at the end
of a run.  Here are the errors right out of my version
(Here is the <a href=errors.txt><b>
list of error messages sorted by type of error message</b></a>
):

<pre>

printf("ERROR(%d): '%s' is a simple variable and cannot be called.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): '%s' requires things of the same type but lhs is %s and rhs is %s.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): '%s' requires things of type %s but lhs is of type %s.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): '%s' requires things of type %s but rhs is of type %s.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Array '%s' should be indexed by a type int but got type %s.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Array index is the unindexed array '%s'.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Cannot have a break statement outside of while loop.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Cannot index nonarray '%s'.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Cannot return an array.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Cannot use array as test condition in %s statement.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Cannot use function '%s' as a simple variable.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Expecting a return type of %s but got none.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Expecting array in parameter %i of call '%s' defined on line %d.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Expecting boolean test condition in %s statement.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Expecting no return value, but got one.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Expecting return type of %s but got type %s.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Expecting type %s in parameter %i of call '%s' defined on line %d.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Not expecting array in parameter %i of call '%s' defined on line %d.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Symbol '%s' is already defined at line %d.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Symbol '%s' is not defined.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): The operation '%s' does not work with arrays.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Too few parameters passed for function '%s' defined on line %d.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Too many parameters passed for function '%s' defined on line %d.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Unary '%s' requires things of type %s but was given type %s.\n",
printf("ERROR(%d): Variable '%s' cannot be declared of type void.\n",


</pre>
<b>NOTE: to shorten the error messages I have converted what used to 
be ERROR lineno(%d) everywhere to ERROR(%d) this includes your yyerror 
routine.  Sorry for the change.</b>

Here are some details by node type but this list is not exhaustive.
You are in control of the design as long as it duplicates my output.

<ul>
<li> For <b>declaration nodes</b> do something like the outline above where insertErr checks 
for duplicate definitions in the symbol table.  Of interest in the outline is the
newScope flag that is set here to prevent the compound statement following the parenthesized
parameter list from opening a new scope.  Notice the scope entry and leave commands. 
<li> For <b>compound statements</b> newScope needs to be handled.

<li> <b>While</b> and <b>If</b> should check they have boolean tests.

<li> <b>Assignments</b> and <b>operators</b> should check that they have the proper
type.  Types of expressions will have to be passed up.  Here I
recommend introducing a new type of variable to the list of types
Void, Integer, Boolean that is <b>ErrorType</b>.  This will be used to
<b>prevent Cascading Errors</b>.  If a type error occurs the type of the
resulting expression can be set to <b>ErrorType</b> and checked for in the
parent nodes as the type is propagated upward.  No error should be
generated because of an operand that is of type <b>ErrorType</b>.

<li> For <b>return</b> check for return type matches.  Again use
<b>ErrorType</b> to prevent the return from issuing an error for
trying to return the result of an expression that has already
generated an error.  Note that it is easy to check that the return is
of the same type.  It is hard to check that a return is made out of a
routine so we will not issue a error for that.  Note that routines
that return void use the return without an argument.  A routine
whose code falls out the bottom will perform a return by default.
(More on this in the next assignment.)

<li> For <b>break</b> check that the break is inside a while loop.

<li> 
Consider using an array or clever function rather than a switch or
cascading if to know what types <b>operators</b> require for the
arguments.  And use the same strategy for remembering what
type is returned.
Some examples are:
<ul>
<li> > takes Integers and returns a Boolean.  
<li> + takes Integers and returns an Integer.
<li> || takes Booleans and returns a Boolean.
<li> - takes an Integer and returns an Integer.
<li> The operators <b>==</b> and <b>!=</b>, 
take arguements that are of the same type (both Boolean
or both Integer) and return a Boolean.
<li> <b>=</b> take arguements that are of the same type 
and returns that type.  This is because assignment is an expression
and can be used in cascaded assignment like:  a = b = c = 314159265
</ul>
See the error
messages above to find an appropriate error message.  Note that
in the error messages above
<b>lhs</b> means left hand side and 
<b>rhs</b> means right hand side.

<li> For <b>Ids</b> you have to see if the variable has been defined or not
and set the type of the Id node to the type of the declaration.  
If the Id is undefined then set it to <b>ErrorType</b>.

<li> Note that for this assignment each undefined or multiply defined
reference must generate an error message.  We'll fix this later.

<li> For Ids you can have <b>arrays</b> that are indexed.  Once they are
indexed their type becomes nonarray.  Check for indexing
of nonarrays and using unindexed arrays where they can't be used.

<li> The <b>function call</b> 
is the trickiest of all.  You must use the symbol table lookup to
find the definition node and from there compare the types in the 
parameter list with the types of the arguments given.  This means
you must traverse the supplied argument before you compare it against
the formal parameters for type match.
Also if you
run out of the parameter list items before you run out of
argument list items you need to issue an error.  Same for running
out of arguments.  See the error messages for an appropriate error.
</ul>

<h3>Symbol Table</h3>

Here is a useful C++ symbol table object you can use: 
<p>
<a href=symtab.cpp><b>symtab.cpp</b></a><br>
<a href=symtab.h><b>symtab.h</b></a><br>
<p>
Here is a brute-force translation 
to C of the the above files (for a single symbol table).
<p>
<a href=symtabc.c><b>symtab.c</b></a><br>
<a href=symtabc.h><b>symtab.h</b></a><br>
<p> 
Here are tests for the OO version (as discussed in class)
and a tar file of all symtab files:
<p>
<a href=symtabTest.cpp><b>symtab tests</b></a><br>
<a href=symtabTest.out><b>symtab expected output</b></a><br>
<a href=symtab.tar><b>tar of all symtab stuff</b></a><br>
<p>
It provides
a symbol table object with insert and lookup methods for symbols
and a pointer (you can use the pointer to point to a TreeNode.
It also has enter and leave methods of managing the scope stack.
Read the symtab.h for
more information on how to use it.
You might want to just play with it to see how it works before you
put it into your compiler (see test routines).
<p> 
One feature of the symbol table is the debug method and the two DEBUG
flags.  At construction time the SymTab object is in nondebugging
mode.  But by setting the flags with the debug method you can get the
object to spew out info.  Use the <b>-s</b> flag to set the debug
flags to DEBUG_TABLE.  This will announce entry into every scope and
prints the symbol table on exit from a scope along with the scope
names. 

<p>
Finally the constructor takes a print routine of the type
void blah(void *).  So if you define somethign to
print a node given a TreeNode * then you can
supply that name to the constructor to print out your
stack.  That way I don't have to know what you TreeNode looks
like internally.  For instance in my code:
<pre>
    symtab = new SymTab(nodePrint);
</pre> 
creates the symbol table and nodePrint is defined as in
this prototype:
<pre>
    void nodePrint(void *p);
</pre> 
<p>
Here is the <a href=symtabTest.cpp><b>
symbol table test routine</b></a> and 
<a href=symtabTest.out><b>expected output</b></a>.

<h3>Example Run</h3> 

Here are <a href=testsA3.tar><b>some example test runs</b></a> 

<h3>Submission</h3>

Homework will be submitted as an <b>uncompressed</b> tar file to the
<a href=submitTar.html>homework submission</a> page.  You can
submit as many times as you like.  <b>The LAST file you submit BEFORE the
deadline will be the one graded.</b>   For all submissions you will receive
email showing how your file performed on the pre-grade tests.  The 
grading program will use more extensive tests and those results will 
be mailed to when they are run.

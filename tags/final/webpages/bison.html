<h1>A Bison Primer</h1>

<p>
Bison is a preprocessor.
Bison can generate C or C++ compatible code.
It is essentially the same program as yacc with a few changes.
<p>
Like Flex
a Bison program has 3 sections: definitions, rules, user subroutines.
Each section is separated by a pair of percents signs (%) in the first
column.
The form is roughly like:
<p>
<pre>
definitions
%%
rules
%%
user subroutine section
</pre>
<p>
<h3>The Definition Section</h3>
In the definitions section you can have a region of
text that is
explicitly copied to the output.  This section usually
contains includes, global variables declarations and
prototypes of functions declared in the user subroutine
section.  This region of copied code is contained 
between  %{ and %} <b>Warning:</b> It is NOT &nbsp; %{ and }%!:
<p>
<pre>
%{
code to copy into the final program
%}
</pre>
<p>
After this comes token declarations, nonterminal type 
declarations, precedence/association 
rules, and other options.
<p>
Tokens are declared by the type of value information they return.
<pre>
%token &lt;dvalue> NUMBER
%token &lt;varindex> NAME
</pre>
Declares token <b>NUMBER</b> to return value information of type &lt;dvalue>
<p>
Nonterminal types must also be declared as in:
<pre>
%type &lt;dvalue> expression
%type &lt;dvalue> term
%type &lt;dvalue> varornum
</pre>
<p>
Which declares <b>expression</b> to return type &lt;dvalue>.
<p>
<p>
A list of equal precedence operators preceded by %left if the operators 
are left associative, or %right if they are right associative, can be
given.  The order in the list is from lowest precedence to 
highest.  For example the three lines in this order:
<pre>
%right implies
%left or xor
%left and
</pre>
Means <b>and</b> has the highest precedence and is left associative.
<b>or</b> and <b>xor</b> are of equal precedence and lower precedence
than <b>and</b> and finally <b>implies</b> is the lowest precedence
and is right associative.
<h3>The Rules Section</h3>
Consists of a collection of productions in a BNF like format.
For each production and in fact for each symbol you can attach
a block of code.  For example:
<pre>
expression: expression '+' term     { $$ = $1 + $3; }
          | term                    { $$ = $1; }
          ;
</pre>
Also see the program example to follow.
<p>
<h3> The User Subroutine Section </h3>
Simply put other routines that you want here including any routines that
refer to routines created by flex such as a main which refers to yyparse.
See below.
<p>
<h3>Example</h3>
Here is a simple numeric calculator program that uses flex to build
a scanner and bison to process the syntax.  A by-product of the 
syntax analysis happens to be the calculations.  For more complex programs
this is not possible.
<p>
The bison source code is <a href=calc.y>calc.y</a><br>
The flex source code is <a href=calc.l>calc.l</a><br>
<p>
Here is a Bourne shell script for our Sun machines to compile a program that
uses both Bison and Flex using either C or C++:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh -x
bison -v -t -d $1.y                # create $1.tab.c and $1.tab.h
flex -d $1.l                          # create lex.yy.c
# gcc -g lex.yy.c $1.tab.c -lfl -lm -o $1  # create calc using C
g++ -DCPLUSPLUS -g $1.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl -lm -o $1  # create calc using C++
</pre>
For bison the <b>-v</b> option creates a <b>.output</b> file that contains
a verbose description of the parser table created including states and
conflicts.  The <b>-t</b> option defines a C macro YYDEBUG that if set
will cause debugging facilities to be turned on.  <b>-d</b> creates
the mandatory <b>.h</b> file for the token definitions that will be used
by the flex file.
<p>

You can choose either the <b>gcc</b> compiler or the <b>g++</b>
compiler note the inclusion of the flex library with <b>-lfl</b> and
the optional math library <b>-lm</b>.  If this scripts is called
<b>dobison</b> then for files <b>calc.y</b> and <b>calc.l</b> you
would call <b>dobison calc</b> and the executable file <b>calc</b>
would be created.

<h2>What are those shift/reduce reduce/reduce errors?</h2>

Bison uses what is known as a shift/reduce parser to build a parse
tree.  In the process of analyzing the input it can either reduce the
code by the use of some production or shift a token onto a stack and
continue looking.  When it can't tell if it should shift or reduce you
get a shift/reduce error and it makes a wild guess what you want.
This generally happens as a result of a ambiguity in your grammar.  If
you get a reduce/reduce error that means it can't tell which of two
production you meant.  It will make a guess and move on.
<p>
If you get these errors look to resolve ambiguities in your grammar.

<h2>A makefile for Bison/Flex</h2>
<pre>
BIN  = cb1   # name of thing to be built goes here
CC   = g++
# CFLAGS = -g
# CCFLAGS = -DCPLUSPLUS -g  # for use with C++ if file ext is .cc
CFLAGS = -DCPLUSPLUS -g  # for use with C++ if file ext is .c

SRCS = $(BIN).y $(BIN).l
OBJS = lex.yy.o $(BIN).tab.o
LIBS = -lfl -lm 

$(BIN): $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(CCFLAGS) $(OBJS) $(LIBS) -o $(BIN)

$(BIN).tab.h $(BIN).tab.c: $(BIN).y
	bison -v -t -d $(BIN).y  

lex.yy.c: $(BIN).l $(BIN).tab.h
	flex -d $(BIN).l  # -d debug

all:    
	touch $(SRCS)
	make

clean:
	rm -f $(OBJS) $(BIN) lex.yy.c $(BIN).tab.h $(BIN).tab.c $(BIN).tar

tar:
	tar -cvf $(BIN).tar $(SRCS) makefile 

</pre>

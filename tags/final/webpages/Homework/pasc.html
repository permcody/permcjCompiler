You complete to make your code smaller or faster than anyone elses.
The restriction is that the code must work correctly.  See rules
below.
<ul>
<li>1st place is 60 points
<li>2nd place is 50 points
<li>3rd place is 40 points
<li>4th place is 30 points
</ul>
Since this is a contest, if you are the only one that competes
and your program runs faster than mine you get 60 points.   So doing something
pays off.  On the down side, if there is a tie for any position,
the lowest ranking is the score you get.  For instance, if there
are three first place finishes, they each get 40 points not 60.  This 
discourages (somewhat) team efforts and puts everyone on an even playing field. 
Some winners of this contest previously have increased their grade by
a letter grade so yes it can make a difference.
<p>
We discussed several kinds of optimizations in class over the last 3
lectures.  Simple and dirty implementations of any of these will get you
a long way.  Small changes can make a difference.
<p>
Rules and observations: 
<ol>
<li>
There will be very little I/O in the routines to optimize.
<li>
You are not allowed to change the I/O routines supplied or the
opening code that calls main.
<li>
Your score is the total amount of time/space used over
several programs which are not known in advance.  To get these
values I will use the 'e' command in the TM.
<li> 
You can only win in either space or time, not both.
<li>
Entering the contest enters you for both automatically.  It is 
easier to implement for me and easier for you to submit. 
<li> You
will get the win with the highest rank.  Therefore, there
are 8 slots for winners.
<li>
You can 
only win if you are faster or smaller than my entry.  My entry 
has no optimizations in it but what you have seen for the last assignment.
<li>
There will be a separate submission site for the contest.  It will
have a test program until the final run when the contest programs will
be loaded.
<li> 
Compilers must execute several normal programs to show 
that they still create correctly working code.  The actual
test programs must also work correctly.  Compilers that
do not generate correct code are disqualified. 
I will not be trying to break the compilers.  I just want to
make sure that code isn't smaller/faster by removing functionality.
<li>
Results will be posted on this site.
<li>
Violation of rules will disqualify your compiler.
<li>
Have fun.
</ol> 
Watch this site.  As people ask quesitons about the rules I will add them here.

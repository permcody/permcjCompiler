<h1>A Make Primer</h1>

[adapted from http://www.cs.niu.edu/~abyrnes/csci241/make.htm]
<p>

In any programming project, even a small one, there is a considerable
amount of typing involved in building a final executable file from a
collection of source code files: Each source code file must be
compiled into an object file.  The object files must be linked with
system libraries into an executable file.  The compilation commands may
have a considerable number of options.  The linking command may contain
several system libraries.  And if changes are made to any source code
file, which files need to recompiled? Or should all of them be
recompiled and linked? The opportunities for mistakes are great,
especially during peak programming hours (10:00 p.m.  - 5:00 a.m.)

<p>
The <kbd>make</kbd> program was designed to build and maintain programming
projects.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>
Like most UNIX commands, <kbd>make</kbd> has numerous options.  The most
useful of these are
</p>

<dl compact="compact">

<dt><kbd>-f</kbd> filename</dt><dd>Uses the filename specified as the
  makefile containing the rules to be used.  By default,
  <kbd>make</kbd> searches for a file of rules named
  <kbd>makefile</kbd> or <kbd>Makefile</kbd>.  </dd>

<dt><kbd>-k</kbd> </dt><dd>Keep going.  By default, <kbd>make</kbd>
  stops building a project as soon as an error occurs.  The use of
  this option forces <kbd>make</kbd> to attempt building other pieces
  of the project as well.  This enables the person building the
  project to collect a large list of errors for debugging purposes,
  rather than being limited to only one error at a time.  </dd>

<dt>target </dt><dd>By giving on the command line the name of a target
  in the makefile, only the rules necessary to make that target and
  its dependencies are executed.  This is useful for project
  maintenance.  Pseudo-targets (see below) that represent common
  sequences of actions can be created.  For example, by creating a
  pseudo-target named <kbd>clean</kbd> which removes all object files
  and executables, the project can be quickly cleaned up by typing
  <kbd>make clean</kbd> at the command prompt.  </dd>

</dl>

<h2>Makefile Rules</h2>


A makefile consists largely of rules, which specify how various
intermediate files in the projects are constructed.  Rules are
separated by blank lines.  Makefile rules consist of three parts --- a
target list, a dependency list and a list of UNIX commands:

<pre>
            target list:  dependency list
                    command 1
                    command 2
                    command 3
                       .
                       .
                       .
</pre>

<h3>Targets</h3>

The target in a makefile rule is usually the name of a file that is to
be made as part of the project.  This is most commonly an executable
file or an object code file.  But it doesn't have to be a file (see
Pseudo-Targets, below).  The target must be separated from the
dependency list with a colon.  The target name should start in the
first column position on the line.

<h3>Dependency Lists</h3>

Dependency lists are lists of files which must all exist and be
<b>up-to-date</b> in order to create the target.  By up-to-date we
mean that the modify date on the file must be later than the
modify date on all the files needed to build that file, if there are
any.  </p>

<p>
The files in
the dependency list must be separated by spaces and placed on one
line.  If the line becomes too long for the editor (a very real
possibility for the dependency lists in a large project), then the
line may be logically extended by typing a <kbd>\</kbd>
<b>immediately</b> followed by a new line.  Anything on the
following line is considered to be logically part of the line extended
with the <kbd>\</kbd>.
If the target is an executable file the dependency list is
probably a list of object code files.  For example </p>

<pre>
          raytrace:  trace.o light.o input.o sphere.o polygon.o ray.o \
                         bound.o triangle.o quad.o
                 (a command goes here to build the executable)

</pre>
Other common dependency lists are made of source code and header files if
the target is an object code file.
<pre>
          trace.o:  trace.cc trace.h rt_attrib.h light.h jitter.h
                 (a command goes here to make the object file)
</pre>

<h3>Commands</h3>

The commands in a makefile rule is simply a set of UNIX commands that would
normally be typed in on the command line to create the target file from the
files in the dependency list:
<pre>
           pxform: pxform.o similar.o affine.o
                g++ -o pxform pxform.o similar.o affine.o -lm
</pre>

An <b>extremely important point</b> about commands in makefile rules
is that they <b>must be indented with a tab character</b>.  They must
<b>not</b> be indented with any spaces.  To use spaces can produce odd
errors that are hard to track down.

<p>

Astoundingly this has been a severe design flaw in the make program
for decades!  By visual inspection it is impossible to tell if spaces or tabs
are being used.  The only way to tell is by using an editor and moving
the cursor around or by using a global substitution command to reveal the
location of stray blanks. </p>

<p> A command in a makefile rule is run only if the target is out of
date with respect to the dependencies.  This is determined by
examining the timestamps on the target and the dependencies.  If any
of the dependencies are newer than the target then the target is
regenerated (hopefully) by executing the commands.  As part of checking
the dependencies of any given rule, the make program will verify that
the dependency is not the target of some other rule.  If it is, then
that new rule is evaluated first.  Only when all of the dependencies
are known to be up-to-date is the comparison made with the target of
the current rule.  </p>

<h3>Rules about Rules</h3>

Some other important points about makefile rules:
<ol>

  <li>The rules are not steps in a program.  They are not run from top
  to bottom.  They are a collection and may be run in any order
  according to the dependencies that need to be satisfied.  The entire
  collection of rules is analyzed along with the timestamps of the
  files involved to determine the specific order to run the commands
  in.  </li>

<li>If no target is specified when <kbd>make</kbd> is invoked, then
  the target of the first rule listed in the file is assumed.  This
  usually means that the rule that makes the project executable(s)
  from the object code files is listed first.  If the project produces
  only a single executable then the rule that creates the executable
  is used.  If the project creates multiple executables, then a
  pseudo-target that depends on all of the executables can be used.
(See below)</li>

<li>Just because it's a common source of errors for beginning makefile
  users, it is repeated here: <b>Always use tabs to indent makefile rule
  commands instead of spaces.</b>  </li>

</ol>
<h3>Pseudo-Targets</h3>

The targets of makefile rules need not correspond to actual files on
the system.  These are called <dfn>pseudo targets</dfn> and can be
very useful for maintaining the project.  One use of rules with pseudo
targets is to create complex commands that can be easily invoked.
These rules have empty dependency lists and are invoked by giving the
target name to <kbd>make</kbd> when it is called.

<p> For example, a common and useful rule in any project has the
pseudo target of "<kbd>clean</kbd>".  </p>

<pre>
           clean:
                  -rm *.o my_executable_files_here
</pre>

This rule, when invoked, will remove all of the object files and any
executable files that are listed as part of the command.  This rule is
invoked by typing <kbd>make clean</kbd> at the command line prompt.

<p>
Many helper rules such as <kbd>all</kbd> for rebuild everything and
<kbd>tar</kbd> for archiving the entire project can be added.
By convention, rules of this form are placed towards the end of the makefile,
after the other rules that actually build the project.
</p>

<p>
Another thing to note in the above example is the hyphen in front of the
<kbd>rm</kbd> command.  When placed immediately in front of the command to be
executed, a hyphen will cause the make program to ignore any errors associated
with the command.  For example, </p>

<pre>
          % make clean
          rm *.o

          ....   A file editing session takes place here


          % make clean
          rm: cannot remove *.o : No such file or directory
          make: [clean] Error 1 (ignored)
          %
</pre>


<p> Another use of a pseudo target is to create a rule for projects
with multiple executables.  This rule has a target and a dependency
list, but no executables: </p>

<pre>
          project:  program1  prog2  mystuff3


          program1: program1.o class2.o otherthings.o
               g++ -o program1 program1.o class2.o otherthings.o -lm

          ...  and so on
</pre>

In this case, the pseudo target <code>project</code> depends on multiple
executable files.  Typing <kbd>make project</kbd> or placing this rule at
the top of the rule list for default application will cause
<kbd>make</kbd> to create all of the executables.

<h2>Variables</h2>

Consider the following situation.  In a large project, a bug has come
up.  It is not known what the source of the bug is.
You have been assigned to debug the problem.  This requires going to
the makefile and adding the debugging option (<code>-g</code>) to all
of the compiling commands.  And after the problem is solved, you must
go back and restore those options to their original form.

<p> To help
this situation, makefiles allow the use of variables.  A makefile
variable is assigned a string value in a similar to an assignment in a
programming language: </p>

<pre>
           CC = g++
</pre>

The symbol CC is the variable and its value is <code>g++</code>.
Makefile variable names are case sensitive.  By convention, they are
all capital letters.  Variables are typically set once, at the
beginning of the makefile.

<p>
There are some standard variable names that are used for common purposes.  The
name <code>CC</code> is used to hold the name of the compiler.  The variable
<code>CCFLAGS</code> holds C++ compiler options and
<code>CFLAGS</code> holds C compiler options.
</p>

<p> Unlike most programming languages, using the value of makefile
variable does not consist of simply giving the variable name.
To use a makefile variable it is necessary to put the name in
parantheses and place a dollar sign in front.  For example, the
variable <code>CC</code> is given a value as described above.  To use
the variable, it is necessary to write the expression
<code>$(CC)</code>.  To use the variable <code>CCFLAGS</code>, the
expression <code>$(CCFLAGS)</code> must be used: </p>

<pre>
         CC = g++
         CCFLAGS = -O -Wall

         ...


         twister:  twister.o  rotate.o
               $(CC) $(CCFLAGS) -o twister  twister.o rotate.o -lm

</pre>

<h2>Built-in Rules</h2>

[under construction]

<h2>Example</h2>

Here is a simple example of a complete makefile for a
relatively small project consisting of several pieces.

<pre>
PROGNAME=fm
CC=g++

CCFLAGS=-O
CFLAGS=$(CFLAGS)
LDFLAGS=-lm
LIB=walshlib.a

SRCS=\
bitutils.cpp\
main.cpp\
mathlib.cpp\
linkage.cpp

HDRS=\
constants.h\
bitutils.h\
main.h\
mathlib.h\
linkage.h

ALLFILES=$(HDRS) $(SRCS) makefile

LIBOBJS=\
bitutils.o\
main.o\
mathlib.o\
linkage.o

main:	main.o $(LIB)
	$(CC) -o $(PROGNAME) $(CCFLAGS) main.o $(LIB) $(LDFLAGS)

all:
	touch  $(SRCS)
	make

$(LIB): $(LIBOBJS)
	echo Build libs
	ar vr $@ $?

size:	$(HDRS)  $(SRCS)
	wc $?

srcs:	$(HDRS)  $(SRCS)
	echo $(HDRS)  $(SRCS)

allfiles: $(ALLFILES)
	echo $(ALLFILES)

clean:
	rm -f *.o core

clobber:
	rm -f *.o *.a core

shar:
	shar -Z $(ALLFILES) > main.shar

backup: $(FILES)
	mv Backup/backup Backup/backup.old
	shar $(ALLFILES) | gzip > Backup/backup

tar:
	tar -cvf ~/fm.tar $(ALLFILES)

</pre>

<h3>Makefile for Bison + Flex</h3>

This file is for use in compiling <b>calc.l</b> and <b>calc.y</b>.

<pre>
BIN  = calc
CC   = gcc
CFLAGS = -g
# CCFLAGS = -DCPLUSPLUS -g  # for use with C++ if file ext is .cc
# CFLAGS = -DCPLUSPLUS -g  # for use with C++ if file ext is .c

SRCS = $(BIN).y $(BIN).l
OBJS = lex.yy.o $(BIN).tab.o
LIBS = -lfl -lm 

$(BIN): $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(CCFLAGS) $(OBJS) $(LIBS) -o $(BIN)

$(BIN).tab.h $(BIN).tab.c: $(BIN).y
	bison -v -t -d $(BIN).y  

lex.yy.c: $(BIN).l $(BIN).tab.h
	flex -d $(BIN).l  # -d debug

all:    
	touch $(SRCS)
	make

clean:
	rm -f $(OBJS) $(BIN) lex.yy.c $(BIN).tab.h $(BIN).tab.c $(BIN).tar

tar:
	tar -cvf $(BIN).tar $(SRCS) makefile 
</pre>

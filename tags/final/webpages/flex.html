<h1>A Flex Primer</h1>
<p>
Flex is a preprocessor.
Flex can generate C or C++ compatible code.
It is essentially the same program as Lex with a few changes.
<p>
A Flex program has 3 sections: definitions, rules, user subroutines.
Each section is separated by a pair of percents signs (%) in the first
column.
The form is roughly like:
<p>
<pre>
definitions
%%
rules
%%
user subroutine section
</pre>
<p>
<h3>The Definition Section</h3>
In the definitions section you can have a region of
text that is
explicitly copied to the output.  This section usually
contains includes, global variables declarations and
prototypes of functions declared in the user subroutine
section.  This region of copied code is contained 
between  %{ and %} <b>Warning:</b> It is NOT &nbsp; %{ and }%!:
<p>
<pre>
%{
code to copy into the final program
%}
</pre>
<p>
After this can come pattern macros and few other options.
<p>
Pattern Macros are defined by giving a name followed by the definition.
For example:
name [a-z][a-z0-9]*

<p>
<h3>The Rules Section</h3>
The rules section contains pattern/action pairs.
<p>
<pre>
pattern action
pattern action
pattern action
</pre>
<p>
The user subroutine section, of course, contains user subroutines
and the main program which usually invokes the yylex subroutine.
<p>
<p>
Patterns are regular expressions for matching strings.
<p>
<table  border=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td width=10%>&nbsp; </td><td>Any character that does not have special meaning matches itself.</tr>
</tr><tr><td> <b>\t</b></td><td> matches tab</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>\n</b></td><td> matches newline</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>.</b></td><td> dot matches any char except a newline</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>\</b></td><td> is used to make any special character lose its special status
and match just the character, except in the special cases where the
\ character has a meaning in C such as tab or newline.</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>*</b></td><td>  matches 0 or more copies of the pattern preceding the *</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>+</b></td><td>  matches 1 or more copies of the previous pattern</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>?</b></td><td>  matches 0 or 1 copies of the previous pattern</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>{x,y}</b></td><td> x through y copies of the previous patterns</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>[&nbsp;]</b></td><td> character set.  If (^) is the first character it is the
inverse or complement of the character set about to be specified.
- in between two characters in a character set means range of characters
as in [a-z] means the lowercase letters and [aeiou] means the vowels and
[a-zA-Z] means all letters.  Note that if you use the not character (^) that 
the resulting character class pattern <b>will match \n</b></td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>/</b></td><td> means "match if followed by" for example dog/cat match the
3 characters "dog" if followed by the three characters "cat".  "cat"
is not actually matched.</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>$</b></td><td>  at the end of a pattern matches at the end of line</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>^</b></td><td>  at the beginning of a pattern matches beginning of line</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>|</b></td><td>  alternation.  cat|dog means cat or dog.</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>""</b></td><td> are takes the contents of the string as characters and not as
special pattern characters.</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>(&nbsp;)</b></td><td> grouping.  (cat|dog)+  is one or more occurrances of cat or dog.</td>
</tr><tr><td> <b>{</b><i>name</i><b>}</b> </td><td>is the invocation of the pattern macro named <i>name</i> that was defined in the definition section.
</tr>
</table>
<p>

<b>Warning:</b> Anytime you want to match a string that contains any
suspicious characters such as say &gt; or &lt; you should enclose the
constant characters in quotes.  For example: dogs"&lt;"[0-9] matches
the word dogs followed by &lt; followed by a digit.  See <a
href=regex.html>A Regular Expression Primer</a> for a comparison with
other regular expression using tools.

<p>
The <b>four rules for matching tokens</b> are:
<ol>
<li> characters are only matched once.  That is, each character is matched
by only one pattern.
<li> longest matching string gets matched first.  That is, if 
one pattern matches "zin" and a later pattern matches "zinjanthropus"
the second pattern is the one that matches.
<li> if same length of matching string then first rule matches.
<li> if no pattern matches then the character is printed to standard output.
</ol>
<p>
<h3> The User Subroutine Section </h3>
Simply put other routines that you want here including any routines that
refer to routines created by Flex such as a main which refers to yylex.
See below.
<h3> Example </h3>
The results of compiling the program with flex will be to create several
variables and a scanner routine called yylex which can be called as
in the example below.
A example
program to print out all of the numbers and words in an input file:

<pre>
%{
#include &lt;stdio.h>
%}
letter [a-zA-Z]
%%
[0-9]+ { printf("NUM:  %s\n", yytext); }
{letter}+ { printf("WORD: %s\n", yytext); }
.|\n     ;
%%
main()
{
        yylex();
}
</pre>
<p>
If this lex file is stored in <b>numwords.l</b> then 
this can be compiled by using:
<p>
<pre>
flex -d  numwords.l   # -d turns on tracing for hardcore debugging
gcc -g lex.yy.c -lfl -o numwords 
</pre>
<p>

This will compile the lex file using flex to generate the lex.yy.c
file.  The <b>-d</b> puts in code to turn on tracing in your scanner.
Then <b>gcc</b> with the debug option <b>-g</b> and adding in the flex
library <b>-lfl</b> and putting the program in <b>numwords</b> using the
<b>-o</b> option.  In this case <b>g++</b> would work as well.

<h2>A makefile for Flex Only</h2>
<pre>
BIN  = t0   # name of thing to be built goes here. e.g. this builds t0
CC   = g++
CFLAGS = -g -DCPLUSPLUS

SRCS = $(BIN).l
OBJS = lex.yy.o
LIBS = -lfl

$(BIN): $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(CCFLAGS) $(OBJS) $(LIBS) -o $(BIN)

lex.yy.c: $(BIN).l
	flex $(BIN).l

clean:
	rm -f $(OBJS) $(BIN) lex.yy.c $(BIN).tab.h $(BIN).tab.c
</pre>

<h1> How to read your grade report </h1>
You are reading this if you want to understand all of the fields
in the grade report that was mailed to you. 
<p> 
<h2>A Description of the Fields</h2>
Not all of these fields may be present.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rank:</b>
<b>LOWER IS BETTER.</b> The person ranked 1 has the best total score in
the class.  <b>People with equal scores are ranked in random order.</b>
<li><b>Last:</b>
This is the rank you had last time I posted grades.  It is kind
of like in the way Billboard does their 
<a href=http://www.billboard.com/billboard/charts/index.jsp>charts</a>.
<li><b>Chg:</b>
The amount your rank has changed since last time I posted grades.
<li><b>Rank Final:</b> Is the rank for just the score on the final.
<li><b>Best:</b>
The best score anyone in the class got.
<li><b>Gap:</b>
The number of points to the next person with a equal or higher grade based on a sort by total point score
<li><b>Est. Grade</b> This a purely an <b>approximate</b>
 grade.  It is made without
all the detail analysis I go through to get the final grades.  It is just
to let you know in the roughest of terms where your grade sits.
<li><b>MaxPoss:</b>
The maximum number of points you could get on this assignment.
<li><b>Mean:</b>
The average of the class on the this assignment.
<li><b>Median:</b>
If all the scores were sorted this score would be the middle one.
If the median is less than the mean that suggests that if the
scores are roughly bell shaped then there is a longer tail to
the lower end of the scores, that is, the distribution is
skewed toward lower scores.
<li><b>Std Dev:</b> If the scores had formed a perfect 
bell shaped curve then the scores roughly two thirds of 
the students would be within a standard deviation of the mean
score.
</ul>
Video student scores are always running 2-3 weeks behind
everyone else.  Until they are turned in the standard deviation
will be skewed because they register as a zero.
<p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<b>What does all this score data really mean</b> If your score is
less than the (median - stdDev) you should worry.
If your score is more than (mean + stdDev) or 90% or better you are doing 
very well.  If you are in the worry category you need to
either see me when you have questions about the homework
and study harder, or you should consider withdrawing.
As always, if I am not in my office, email me.  Odds are I
am logged on somewhere in the world.
<p>
<b>The percentage score I got on my last homework
was really bad.  Isn't it going to really hurt my
grade?</b>
The percentage on a given assignment doesn't really count for much.  It is
the total points that count.  If the assignment 
was worth 20 points it probably won't have much
effect.  If the assignment was 100 points then it probably
will have an effect. 
<p> 
<b>How can I tell what letter grade I will get?</b>
I am unable to write assignments that map well
to a percentage.  See <a href=/~heckendo/CS445/policies.html>statement of grading policies</a>
for more information.
I do what, in fact, many instructors do I grade by looking for gaps. 
I will be influenced by these factors: 
<ol>
<li> where the mean, median, and stddev of the scores lie.
<li> where the 90% boundary is.  If you have scored at
least 90%, you will probably get an A. 
<li> where the gaps are in the distribution of scores.  I
am more likely to draw the lines between letter grades between
more widely separated groups of scores than closer together. 
</ol>

If you have fallen behind this is your big chance to catch up.  So in
order to pass the course you need to keep up with the work.  With this
assignment I want to get everyone back on track.  The main credit for
this course is the compiler itself.  I want to be able to congratulate
everyone on having built their own compiler.  (Yes, all compiler
courses are like this.)
<p>
<b>NOTE: I will be out of town from Apr 3 through Apr 10.
There will be no class.</b>  You can catch up on your compiler
work with those extra hours.  
<p>

There are several parts to this assignment.

<h3>New Errors</h3>
The following errors should be added:
<ol>
<li>
An error should be printed if a parameter in a function declaration or
a variable should be declared to be of type void.  The error message should be:
<pre>
printf("ERROR lineno(%d): %s cannot be of type void.\n", 
</pre>
<li> 
An error should be printed if a variable is called as a function.
The error message should be:
<pre>
printf("ERROR lineno(%d): %s is a simple variable and cannot be called.\n",
</pre>

<li> 
An error should be printed if a function name is used as a variable.
The error message should be:
<pre>
printf("ERROR lineno(%d): Cannot use function %s as a simple variable.\n",
</pre>
</ol>

<h3>Nicer Errors</h3>
<p>
<img src=../../Icons/updated.gif>
I forgot this small part.  I will give you some code for it.
The message that comes back from the parser to yyerror sometimes
says expecting some kinds of tokens and sometimes says other
things.  I would like you test for this using the function
<b>strstr</b> and emmit two kinds of
errors.  Since I forgot to tell you this I make up for that
by giving you some code.  You can detect the type of 
error message you were given by testing if the message contains
the string "expecting" (yes a little cheezy but will serve).  Here
is some code from my yyerror to show you what I mean:

<pre>
    if (strstr(msg, "expecting")) {
	printf("ERROR lineno(%d): %s but got: %s\n", lineno, msg, scanToken);
	numErrors++;
    }
    else {
	printf("ERROR lineno(%d): Unexpected token: %s\n", lineno, scanToken);
	numErrors++;
    }
</pre>

This will help you match my error messages.  You don't have to implement
it this way.


<h3>Error Count</h3>
There will be two global variables counting
the number of errors and number of warnings.
At the end of assignment 3 we only hand errors.  Warnings will not
stop the successful compiliation of the program.  Keep count of 
both kinds and report at the end of the compile as in this example:
<pre>
Number of errors: 1
Number of warnings: 2
</pre>
<h3>Compiler Phases</h3>
Our compiler now was three phases: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and
semantic analysis.  Each phase 
can produce its own errors.  Inspired by a student
question from class I think I want to perserve that.  
Here is the desciption of what you need to do:
<ul>
<li><b>lexical analysis:</b>
In this phase each input character that is not part of 
a legal token is reported as a warning.  I have modified by
yyerror routine to help me do error reporting in one place.
You can do this as you like.
yylex does not return a token for these "bad characters" 
and the lexical analysis
continues to run.
Example warning to use:
<pre>
WARNING lineno(2): Invalid input character: ^.  Character ignored.
WARNING lineno(2): Invalid input character: #.  Character ignored.
</pre>
These errors will increase the global warning count.

<li><b>syntax analysis:</b>
The syntax analysis errors will continue to work as before 
(except as noted below) but
these errors will also increase the global error count.

<li><b>semantic analysis:</b>
If there are <b>no errors</b> in the syntax analysis then
you proceed to semantic analysis.
The errors in semantic analysis will increase the global error count.
</ul>

<h3>Inserting Error Tokens</h3>

Add the following error productions to the grammar:
<pre>
'(' error ')'                                 { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR paren exp\n"); yyerrok;}
'{' error '}'                                 { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR compound\n"); yyerrok;}
ID '(' error ')'                              { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR call\n"); yyerrok;}
IF '(' error ')' matched ELSE matched         { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR matched IF 1\n"); yyerrok;}
IF '(' error ')' matched ELSE unmatched       { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR unmatched IF 2\n"); yyerrok;}
IF '(' error ')' statement                    { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR unmatched IF 1\n"); yyerrok;}
IF '(' expression ')' error ELSE matched      { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR matched IF 2\n"); yyerrok;}
IF '(' expression ')' error ELSE unmatched    { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR unmatched IF 3\n"); yyerrok;}
RETURN error ';'                              { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR return\n"); yyerrok;}
WHILE '(' error ')' matched                   { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR matched while 1\n"); yyerrok;}
WHILE '(' error ')' unmatched                 { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR unmatched WHILE 1\n"); yyerrok;}
arg_list ',' error                            { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR arglist 4\n")}
arg_list error expression                     { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR arglist 3\n"); yyerrok;}
arg_list error                                { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR arglist 2\n")}
error '(' params ')' compound_stmt            { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR fun_declaration 1\n"); yyerrok;}
error ';'                                     { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR expression_stmt\n"); yyerrok;}
error ';'                                     { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR var_declaration\n"); yyerrok;}
error                                         { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR arglist 1\n")}
type_specifier ID '(' error ')' compound_stmt { $$=NULL; printf("**ERROR fun_declaration 2\n"); yyerrok;}
</pre>

The result of adding these tokens will be that you have 3 shift/reduce conflicts.  We will
discuss why in class but in short:

<ol>

<li> local_declarations can be an error
<pre>
    compound_stmt  ->  '{' . local_declarations statement_list '}'   (rule 21)
    compound_stmt  ->  '{' . error '}'   (rule 22)
</pre>

<li> statement_list can be empty
<pre>
    compound_stmt  ->  '{' local_declarations . statement_list '}'   (rule 21)
    local_declarations  ->  local_declarations . var_declaration   (rule 23)
</pre>

<li> The follow set of arg_list can contain ')'
<pre>
    call  ->  ID '(' error . ')'   (rule 86)
    arg_list  ->  error .   (rule 91)
</pre>
</ol>

<h3>Submission</h3>

Homework will be submitted as an <b>uncompressed</b> tar file to the
<a href=../submitTar.html>homework submission</a> page.  You can
submit as many times as you like.  <b>The LAST file you submit BEFORE the
deadline will be the one graded.</b>   For all submissions you will receive
email showing how your file performed on the pre-grade tests.  The 
grading program will use more extensive tests and those results will 
be mailed to when they are run.
<p>

If you have tests you really think are important or just cool please
send them to me and I will consider adding them to the test suite.

<b>Psssst.</b>  It seems we have only four entries <b>so far</b> in the speed/size contest.
Some people could make a quick killing here by making a small
improvement to my code generator.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hot.gif>&nbsp;5/9/04</b>
Here are some of the speed/space tests:
<ul>
<li><a href=queens.c->N-queens Problem</a>
<li><a href=permlist.c->Lexicographic Permutations</a>
	
</ul>
I am open to suggestions.  email your favorite test.

It has come up twice now that getopt on Sun and on Linux work slightly
differently... probably no surprise.  Here is how: getopt on Linux
will look though <b>all</b> of argv for any dash options.  On Sun it
looks for the <b>first contiguous set</b> of dash options.  Any
nondash option like a filename disrupts it the search.    The result is
that:

<pre>
c- factor.c- -o factor.tm
</pre>

may work on Linux but not on Sun.  Not trying to be tricky but just
writing the tests up I coded all the tests with the -o at the end.  If
you see your TM code in the test output, or you seen lots of TM usage
messages, or you find that all your *.tm files are missing this might be the cause.
<p>
Not a problem
a simple enclosing loop about the getopt function
and an increment of optind (see man page) whenever
you grab a filename will get past this on Sun.

<img src=../Icons/compass1.gif><b>&nbsp;5/6/04</b>
In prioritizing work on the codegen work to get
your code generator to do at least one test program perfectly.
If you get nearly everything right but do something that
breaks the code for all possible programs then it
is hard to see what you have done or how near to correct it
is.  Rank the test programs I supplied 
by which you want to get working first.
Then study the code generated.  You know it is highly patterned code
because my brain dead code generator looks at the node and then writes
the code.  Don't forget that for some nodes it can do things like:
<pre>
donode(thisNode)
{
	write some code for thisNode
	donode(thisNode->child[0])
	write some code for thisNode
	donode(thisNode->child[1]) 
	write some code for thisNode
}
</pre> 
etc.  But the 20 some examples of code I supplied are a road map for 
implementing your code generator.
<ul>
<li><b>As always turn something in</b>
<li>If you are having a hard time getting things to work submit it and
ask me a <b>specific</b> question, give me the time stamp 
and I will look at your code. 
<li><b>Try
to pass at least on of the tests that involves output.</b>
</ul>
<img src=../Icons/newyellow.gif>
<p>
<img src=../Icons/idea.gif><b>&nbsp;5/6/04</b> 
To answer a question mailed to me, 
the prolog I am expecting for the speed/size contest is
the prolog in the code examples I supplied.

<p>
<img src=../Icons/flask.gif><b>&nbsp;5/5/04</b>
OK, the test tool is up and running for assignment 5.  The
short circuit test changed.  Go to it!  I will devise some 
evil tests for the speed and space competition and get that
up soon.  The Bonus problem in assignment 5 will be run as a separate
final test.  Two examples are provided in the problem spec.

Since we speeded through the allocation of variable length objects in
the heap using strings as an example and the how to convert C- into 
a linker for C-.  There is no need to come to class Thursday.  <b>Thursday 
class is canceled</b> so you can work on your prep for finals and <b>your compiler
project</b>.  This was a great class!  Thanks for the great questions from the
class.  <b>Watch your deadlines</b> and have a good summer.

The <a href=Homework/pasc.html>speed/space contest</a>
is posted.  The due date is the <b>end of finals week</b>.
Note that if no one shows up for the contest and you 
make a small improvement then you win.

I have put the <b>code for TM version 2.4</b> which has
the <b>u</b> command so you can do <b>tm &lt;stuff.in >stuff.out</b> if
<b>stuff.in</b> begins with the <b>u</b> command.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/bolt.gif><b>&nbsp;4/26/04</b>
Be thinking about what features you would add to C-.
I would like to discuss the language sometime in class.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/wand.gif><b>&nbsp;4/26/04</b>
The <a href=Homework/pas5.html><b>assignment 5</b></a>
is posted!!

<b>Student evaluations</b> are available for you to grade this course.
<p> 
<img src=../Icons/flask.gif><b>&nbsp;4/16/04</b> 
The disk has been filled by student's programs looping on
errors.  I have put a possible fix for this into the test code.
I hope it will solve the problem.  It "should" kill your program if
it generates too much output.  Be sure to use flushing I/O:
You can flush stdout for
printf by calling <b>fflush(stdout);</b> after printfs.
You can flush cout output by using <b>endl</b> or <b>flush</b> in the
output stream. 
<p>
<img src=../Icons/flask.gif><b>&nbsp;4/16/04</b>
I will ignore the imfamous line 50 error on errors4.c-.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/info2.gif><b>&nbsp;4/13/04</b>
I have added a quicky <b>intro to debugging</b> with gdb in
the documents below.  When you want to know where
an error occurred in your code you can use gdb to tell you.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/wand.gif><b>&nbsp;4/13/04</b>
As I mentioned in class on Tuesday I would <b>move the 
due date of assignment 4</b> back but I would not change the
<b>due date of assignment 5</b> which I will release by Tuesday.
I want everyone to succeed in building the compiler.  If 
you have questions ask.  I will try to set you on the 
right track.  If you get stuck again then ask again.
The code gen section will be worth about 300-400 points
and will be due right before finals so if you want to
study for finals you need to plan your time.
<p> 
<img src=../Icons/wand.gif><b>&nbsp;4/13/04</b> 
I have <b>adjusted my version of the compiler</b> as requested by
vote of the class.  I hope that works better for people.
The adjustments include Neil's request that I uppercase the
work while in the error messages associated with the error token
for the while statements.
<p> 
<img src=../Icons/wand.gif><b>&nbsp;4/11/04</b> 
Who said writing compilers was easy... another thing that was
pointed out was that some error messages supplied by bison
may print out expected tokens in a different order.  I will
either put a filter on this so it will match or will instruct
the grader to ignore those differences since they are hard to control.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;4/11/04</b> 
It was pointed out that there was a change in the error messages from
last time.  The reason is something small that I forgot to tell
you to do to yyerror.  I have included the instructions and even
code to help you make the small adjustment.  See assignment 4 which
has been updated with a small section called <b>Nicer Errors</b>.
Sorry for the this minor change.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/flask.gif><b>&nbsp;4/11/04</b>
<b>Tests for assignment 4</b> have been installed and copies of 
the test files can be found 
in the tar on the submission page.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/wand.gif><b>&nbsp;4/1/04</b>
I will be gone from Apr 2-10.  Have a week.  There is no class
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;4/1/04</b>
<a href=Homework/pas4.html><b>assignment 4</b></a> is posted so
you can get started on it.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/info2.gif><b>&nbsp; 3/31/04</b> 
I have posted the
<a href=bisonErrorToken.html>
first shot at information on the error token</a>.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;3/28/04</b>
Notice on <b>assignment 3</b> that if a procedure is undefined the
parameter list is not checked.  This was probably not the
best decision on my part but that is the way code was implemented.
You should do the same for now.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/wand.gif><b>&nbsp;3/27/04</b>
The <b>submit test script</b> should now be running every 5 minutes.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/bomb.gif><b>&nbsp;3/27/04</b>
I have <b>corrected my spelling</b> of parameter in the test files
that will be run via the submission page.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;3/27/04</b>
I have <b>augmented the tests</b> just a bit on the submission page.  I have included
a test file that has no errors and one that has some
errors we aren't handling yet but it should still 
generate some of the correct errors.  Also I have added a test for the -p 
option.  I won't be testing the -s option but I find it a helpful debugging
tool.  Finally, one more helpful thing is that I have added tests to
the examples link off the assignment and all examples include both
a regular run and a -p option run so you have more information.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;3/23/04</b>
<b>Hint for getting complete output in the face of an error.</b>
If your programs get an error this may trash the output 
buffers before they print making it appear like you had
not output anything.  You can flush stdout for
printf by calling <b>fflush(stdout);</b> after printfs.
You can flush cout output by using <b>endl</b> or <b>flush</b> in the
output stream.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/info2.gif><b>&nbsp; 3/22/04</b>
I have posted to the documentation section a reference
for how to read your grade report that I will or have
mailed to you.
<p> 
<img src=../Icons/wand.gif><b>&nbsp;3/16/04</b>
I have added to homework 3 a <b>C translation of the
C++ symbol table</b> routine for a single symbol table. 
Feel free to use this 
code.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;3/12/04</b>
CHeck for the updated homework assignment 3.  <b>Believe me
when I say it is a lot of work.</b> 
<p> 
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;3/11/04</b>
The <a href=Homework/mt.html><b>practice midterm</b></a>
is now posted.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif>
<b>&nbsp;3/11/04</b> 
The <b>midterm is scheduled for Thurs Mar 25.</b> 
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;3/10/04</b>
<a href=Homework/pas3.html><b>assignment 3</b></a> is posted so
you can get started on it.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/info2.gif><b>&nbsp; 3/9/04</b>
I have posted the very readable and helpful <b>bison manuals.</b> 
I posted both the one for 1.20 and the 1.35 rewrite.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp; 3/9/04</b>
A really small detail, but just so you know.  The test system
is switching over to gmake (gnu make) instead of make
because of earlier problems with make on the Sun.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/info2.gif><b>&nbsp; 3/8/04</b>
The most popular question these days is <b>"so when is that 
test anyway?"</b>.  I will post on the web a sample test before 
the break.  It will be due after the break.  This will be how
you study for the real test.  You will have to turn in the sample
test.  Not sure how that will work yet.  I will probably have you grade
your own sample tests.  Then the last half of the week after spring
break we will have the real test.  It will look a whole lot like the
sample test.  So you just need to understand the concepts in the sample
test.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp; 3/6/04</b>
Another thing that seems cause people problem is char *'s. 
In particular strcpy.  While a great routine in its place
I have yet to see it used successfully on this assignment.
What you want to do is for this assignment is make a <b>separate</b>
copy of the token found in yytext <b>for every token</b>.  (don't worry
about the memory leak at the moment.)
You need a pointer to this newly allocated space so that you can
use it for your error messages and for returning to your bison
code via yylval.  I think a good rule of thumb based on what
other students have done with strcpy is <b>don't use strcpy</b>.
It gets you in trouble.
<b>Use strdup.</b>

<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp; 3/6/04</b>
Several bugs occur in people's programs related to <b>#include</b>
statements.  First, see the remark below about globals.h.
Second, be sure  you include your globals.h <b>BEFORE</b> your
tab.h file in your flex file.  Otherwise when the compiler
reads your tab.h and finds a type like TreeNode it won't know
what it is because it has not read the globals.h file yet.  Finally,
never put executable code in a <b>.h</b file.  It isn't illegal, it 
is just that if you include it in multiple places you will get 
duplicate definitions and link time.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp; 3/4/04</b>
The source code for tests for the assignments can be found
on the submission page.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/idea.gif><b>&nbsp; 3/1/04</b>
<b>Hint:</b> if you make a <b>%union</b> that uses <b>TreeNode</b> and 
<b>TreeNode</b> is declared in your globals then you
will need to include your globals.h file in
your flex file as well as your bison file
<p>
<img src=../Icons/flask.gif><b>&nbsp; 3/1/04</b>
The test scripts are in place for assignment 2.  Let me know if
they stop working or if you find a bug.  Have fun.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/idea.gif><b>&nbsp;2/27/04</b>
Several people have asked me questions that resolves to
what happens if nothing is after a production in Bison. 
The answer is the default action is <b>{ $$=$1; }</b>.
So the type of the first thing in the production <b>$1</b>better
match the type of the thing returned <b>$$</b>.  A way <b>not</b> 
to get this default assignment is to use <b>{&nbsp;}</b> on each production. 
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;2/25/04</b>
I have added information on <b>first and follow sets</b> in the documentation
section below.
<p> 
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;2/23/04</b> 
<a href=Homework/pas2.html>Assignment 2</a> has been updated to a complete 250pt assignment.
Do not put off working on this complex assignment.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;2/22/04</b>
Test data for the grading assignment 1 is found on
the homework submission page. 
<p> 
<img src=../Icons/hand_r.gif><b>&nbsp;2/15/04</b>
<a href=Homework/pas2.html><b>assignment 2</b></a> is posted so
you can get started on it.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/idea.gif><b>&nbsp;2/13/04</b>
If you first <b>submit your code</b> to the homework submit page then
send me email about your problem I can bring up the results of 
the code and execution that occurred and better comment on why
your code is failing.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/idea.gif><b>&nbsp;2/13/04</b>
The first test in the tests for the homework is
a file given on the <b>command line</b> and not from
stdin.  The other two are from stdin.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/bomb.gif><b>&nbsp;2/13/04</b> 
If you <b>submit your homework</b> to a name other 
than your last name it won't know where to email your
results.  So if you submit your homework
and you don't get a reply in 30 min check that the
name is your last name.
<p>
<img src=../Icons/flask.gif><b>&nbsp;2/9/04</b>
<a href=submitTar.html><b>homework submission page</b></a> is posted.
It is experimental <img src=../Icons/skull.gif> so be kind and don't
run things with infinite loops or other nasties.  Submit a tar file for
testing.  The last submission before the deadline is your final submission. 
Please report any problems you are having so I can fix them.  Thanks.

<h2>Class Description</h2>
<p>

An introduction to compiler design and construction.  This is a
hands-on construction course in which each student will work
independently to construct a compiler that actually works.

<h2>Class Goals</h2>

<ol>

<li> Understand the basic theory of languages and techniques for
simple language translation. 

<li> Understand the features of compilers and interpreters.

<li> Understand the basic components and layered design of
a compiler and the rational for their use.

<li> Each student will be responsible
for independently building a simple compiler for a virtual machine and
augment it with new features.  The instructor will help the 
student to achieve this goal over a series of assignments, but it 
is up to the student to keep up with the assignments and complete
each on time.
